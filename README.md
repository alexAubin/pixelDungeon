Pixel Dungeon
=============

An adventure with 64 pixels

Description
-----------

This is an arduino project aimed to build a free/open-source handheld video game console based on [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/en/) and using a 64 RGB pixel matrix as display. It aims to run a minimalistic RPG-game inspired by [TinyHack](http://boingboing.net/2011/06/20/tinyhack-minimalist-1.html) and [Rogue-like games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) and to make it easy to implement other games.
